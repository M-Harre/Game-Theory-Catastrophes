# Game-Theory-Catastrophes
This repository contains the Mathematica code used to develop the work on Catastrophe Theory for game theory that appears in my 2023 article in the journal "Games and Economic Behavior".

If you use this code in your research please cite the original article in which this work appears:
"On the smooth unfolding of bifurcations in quantal-response equilibria"
Games and Economic Behavior (2023), Adam Harris, Scott McCallum & Michael S. Harré.
Special issue: 25+ years of Quantal Response Equilibrium

This notebook provides the Mathematica code for generating each of the diagrams in the GEB (2023) paper, together with contextualising comments for each code fragment and its diagram. We include here a superset of the diagrams from the GEB (2023) paper, in order to illustrate better the capability of our software.

It is written in a tutorial style so that you can recreate the mathematical steps needed to logically progress through the steps of the proofs in the GEB (2023) article.
